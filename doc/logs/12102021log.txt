## Analysis log for 12.11.2021
Performing simulations with 20x20 grids for inference-based and model-free agents
in 100-0 environments

This is to equalize the number of agents for the two strategies and test the effect on the decoding performance

Refitted the simulations on 1000 blocks, model-free and inf-based
IMPORTANT: changed trials_per_block = [15, 25] from [10, 40]
New decoding file saved at `svmresults_from_pickle_121021_prob0.00.mat`, and in folder `simdata/12102021`

- Re-organized code into levels with clearer structure, marking deprecated code with `_deprecated`

- Re-organized `processed_data/simdata` folder (separating sim results of different days into separate folders)

- Changed svm config path (which stores segmentation parameters) in new path: `processed_data/svm/configs` (old path was in PaperFigures/code/decodeFigs)
