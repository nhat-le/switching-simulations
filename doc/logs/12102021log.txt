## Analysis log for 12.11.2021
Performing simulations with 20x20 grids for inference-based and model-free agents
in 100-0 environments

This is to equalize the number of agents for the two strategies and test the effect on the decoding performance

Refitted the simulations on 1000 blocks, model-free and inf-based
IMPORTANT: changed trials_per_block = [15, 25] from [10, 40]
New decoding file saved at `svmresults_from_pickle_121021_prob0.00.mat`, and in folder `simdata/12102021`

- Re-organized code into levels with clearer structure, marking deprecated code with `_deprecated`

- Re-organized `processed_data/simdata` folder (separating sim results of different days into separate folders)

- Changed svm config path (which stores segmentation parameters) in new path: `processed_data/svm/configs` (old path was in PaperFigures/code/decodeFigs)

- In `PaperFigures/code/decode_perf_figures.m`, removed filtering of outliers for offset (offset_flat < -20 = nan is removed).

- Removed filtering of features. Note that there was a mild filtering taking place in `PaperFigures/code/load_data.m` where offset values below -20 are clipped (disabled this feature on 12.11.2021). This affects the plots of the svm segmentation
(TODO: will need to re-do these plots)

- Removed filtering in `PaperFigures/code/decoding/decode_perf_figures.m`
